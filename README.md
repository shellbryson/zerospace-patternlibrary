SpaceGirl Pattern Library

## What is this?

This is a Fabric pattern library, designed to be compiled and presented by the Fabric framework. That
means you'll need to have Fabric checked out and installed.

You can ge Fabric here: `https://bitbucket.org/blonde/blonde-fabric`

## Prerequisites

* Node 6.4 or above
* Grunt CLI 1.2 or above
* Fabric 0.11.1 or above

## Getting started

This Pattern Library is interactive via Fabric. To launch it:

* Check out this project into a the `src/build` folder of Fabric (you've probably done that if you're reading this).
* Run `npm install` to install all the required support for Node
* Run `bower install` to install all the compiled Pattern Library prerequisites.
* Ensure you have also installed Fabric (`npm install` from its root)

You can then run Fabric.

This will launch the Pattern Library for exploration. While running, any file changes under
`/src/build` will be compiled on the fly and updated in your browser.
